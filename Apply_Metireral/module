您好，我想咨询学校申请有关的问题
# 以下是我的背景
我的毕业院校是中国人民公安大学，是中国警察类院校的TOP1，政法类院校TOP4；
我的专业是法庭科学，部分专业课：电子物证，指纹学，足迹学，DNA，法医学等

# 以下是我的工作经历以及兴趣转变
我在学校上电子取证课程的时候就被计算机吸引了，这也是为什么我毕业论文选择深度学习在刑事技术中应用的方向，并拿到了北京市的优秀毕业论文；工作之后我从事电子物证工作，在工作中不断学习计算机知识，到MIT、赫尔辛基、Coursera等地方学习，并被推荐参加省级电子取证比武；在不断的接触中，我萌生了深造计算机科学的想法；
我了解到荷兰有关的学习政策，十分认同你们的教育理念，并对你们高水准的教育及科研水平十分心动，想申请贵校的研究生；
# 以下是我的问题
 一、我的专业课背景并不匹配，是否有方法可以补学分以达到录取基本要求？
 二、我参加赫尔辛基开放大学的补学分课程，你们是否认可？
 三、类似Coursera、edX、MOOC的课程补学分是否可行？


Dear Admissions Office of Delft University,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the master's application process and credit background requirements.

Firstly, let me briefly introduce my background. I graduated from China People's Public Security University, which ranks as the top 1 in police universities and top 4 in law universities in China. My major was Forensic Science, with courses focusing on electronic evidence, fingerprinting, footprint analysis, DNA, etc. During my time at university, I developed a strong interest in the field of computer science.I chose to delve into the application of deep learning in criminal technology for my graduation thesis, which earned me the Outstanding Thesis Award in Beijing. After graduation, I worked in electronic evidence and continuously expanded my knowledge in computer science. I also completed several relevant courses on platforms like MIT's Opencourseware and Helsinki Open Uni, with a plan to conduct in-depth research on binary security in the field of computer science. I am aware of the rigorous educational philosophy and high standards of education and research in the Netherlands, which is why I am eager to pursue the graduate program at your esteemed university and become a part of your academic community.

With that said, I have a few inquiries:

1. My academic background may not directly align with the admission requirements of your university. Are there any options available to supplement my credits to meet the basic admission criteria?
2. I have undertaken credit courses at Helsinki Open University. Would these credits be recognized by your university?
3. I have completed various courses on platforms such as Coursera and edX. Would these courses be considered as supplementary credits?

I would greatly appreciate your guidance on these matters. Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,

Yangli
