尊敬的贵校招生办公室，
您好，我想咨询学校申请有关的问题
# 以下是我的背景
我的毕业院校是中国人民公安大学，是中国警察类院校的TOP1，政法类院校TOP4，双一流高校；
我的专业是法庭科学，部分专业课：电子物证，指纹学，足迹学，DNA，法医学；
我数学和计算机相关的课程分数很高，包括但不限于：高等数学，概率论与数理统计，线性代数，程序设计；

# 以下是我的工作经历以及兴趣转变

在学习电子取证课程期间，我被计算机所吸引，因此选择了深度学习在刑事技术中的应用作为毕业论文的方向，并且荣获北京市优秀毕业论文奖。毕业后，我从事电子物证工作，并不断学习计算机知识，通过MIT的Opencourseware和赫尔辛基的Open Uni完成了多门课程，并被推荐参加省级电子取证比武。

随着不断的学习，我萌生了深造计算机科学的想法，并以攻读博士学位为学业目标，以二进制和硬件安全为科研目标。我相信我的工作经历将有助于拓宽我的科研方向。我对贵校高水准的教育、科研水平以及强大的工科实力深表钦佩，因此特别希望能够申请贵校的研究生项目。


# 以下是我的问题

我的专业课背景并不完全匹配计算机科学专业的录取基本要求，是否有可能通过额外学分或考试来弥补相关课程要求？
贵校是否认可我在赫尔辛基开放大学所获得的学分？
是否可以通过参加类似Coursera、edX、MOOC的在线课程来补充学分？
我参与开源项目的经历是否对我的申请有帮助？能否推荐一些合适的开源项目？

非常感谢您的时间，期待您的回复。

此致，
杨立


Dear Admissions Office,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the application process at your esteemed university.

Below is a brief overview of my background:

I graduated from the People‘s Public Security University of China, which is ranked as the top university in China for police education and the fourth in the field of political and legal studies. It is also considered a Double First-Class university.

My major is Forensic Science, with courses including Electronic Evidence, Fingerprint Identification, Footprint Analysis, DNA Analysis, and Forensic. Additionally, I have achieved high scores in mathematics and computer-related courses, including but not limited to Advanced Mathematics, Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Programming.

During my studies in digital forensics, I became fascinated by computer science. Consequently, I chose to focus my graduate thesis on the application of deep learning in criminal technology, which earned me the Outstanding Graduate Thesis Award in Beijing. After graduation, I pursued a career in digital evidence analysis while continuously enhancing my knowledge of computer science. I have completed several courses through MIT's OpenCourseWare and the Open University of Helsinki, and was recommended to participate in provincial-level digital evidence competitions.

As I continued to learn, I developed an interest in furthering my studies in computer science with a focus on binary and hardware security, with the goal of obtaining a doctoral degree. I believe that my professional experience will contribute to broadening my research direction. I greatly admire your university's high standards of education, research excellence, and strong engineering capabilities, and therefore, I am particularly interested in applying for your graduate program.

I have a few questions regarding the application process:

1.My academic background may not entirely match the basic requirements for admission to the computer science program, is it possible to compensate for this through additional credits or examinations?
2.Does your university recognize credits obtained from the Open University of Helsinki?
3.Can I supplement my credits by participating in online courses similar to Coursera, edX, or MOOC?
4.Would my involvement in open-source projects be beneficial to my application? Could you recommend some suitable open-source projects?

Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[name]
